# 2.8" ESP32 Touch CYD Snap-Fit Case (`rev1`)

![2.8 CYD Case Hero Render](images/preview_hero_assembled_28_rev1.png)

Hey makers! Jimmy here from BoxerDawg 3D. After releasing our 3.5" snap-fit case, a lot of folks in the community reached out asking for a tailored version for the classic **2.8" Cheap Yellow Display (ESP32-2432S028R)**. 

I sat down in Blender 5.2 and designed this enclosure from the ground up to fit the 2.8" CYD like a glove. Just like the 3.5" case, it's a **100% support-free, 2-piece snap-fit design**—no tiny screws, no brass heat-set inserts, and zero glue required. You drop your board in, click the bezel on, and you're ready to head outdoors or toss it in your gear bag!

## 🖨️ Recommended Print Settings

I dialed this in on my Bambu Lab printers (X1-Carbon and A1 Mini), but any modern bed-slinger or CoreXY will print it beautifully:

- **Supports**: **NONE (`0`)** — Every angle and bridge is engineered to print cleanly with zero support material.
- **Orientation**: Both parts sit flat on `Z = 0`:
  - **Base Shell**: Floor facing the bed (so the debossed BoxerDawg3D logo and cooling louvers print crisp against your plate).
  - **Top Bezel**: **Pre-flipped face-down on `Z = 0`**! This lets your front screen bezel inherit the textured PEI finish of your build plate, and the 45° screen chamfer prints without sagging.
- **Layer Height**: 0.20 mm Standard (0.4 mm nozzle).
- **Wall Loops**: 3 walls (ensures crisp, rigid perimeter snaps).
- **Infill**: 15% Gyroid (great strength-to-weight balance).
- **Filament**: PLA, PLA Tough, PLA Matte, or PETG.
- **Print Time**: ~45 minutes total for both pieces on a Bambu Lab printer.

## 🛠️ Assembly Instructions

1. **Check Your Clearances**:
   Inspect the 4 corner support bosses in the base shell to make sure your first layer is clean.
2. **Drop in the Board**:
   Angle the USB port into the left port opening, then lower the board flat into the base. The board will seat cleanly on the 4 corner bosses with no rocking.
3. **Snap on the Bezel**:
   Orient the bezel so the light sensor opening matches the LDR at the top left. Press firmly along the long edges until both locking tabs snap into their detents with a solid click.
4. **Taking it Apart**:
   If you ever need to get inside to swap firmware or solder pins, just slip a thumbnail or plastic pry tool into the pry scoop on the bottom edge and pop the bezel off.
